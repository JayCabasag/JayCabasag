### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a software engineer and front-end engineer here in the Philippines

_On top of that, I also have another GitHub account [JayCabasag99](https://github.com/JayCabasag99), which is where I frequently push my commits._

I love programming. I know we sometimes hate it, but programming unlocks infinite knowledge in this modern era. It's like exploring an endless dungeon of ideas, competing with world bosses in this industry. It's also like trying to achieve what legendary developers have accomplished.

About me, at the moment, I am particularly interested in web development. I often utilize `JavaScript/TypeScript` to develop web applications. I usually utilize `Node.js` as my backend when I'm developing a full-stack application. I also use other programming languages like `Java` and `Go`. I usually use `Java` for Android application development, but I plan to build a backend or RESTful API. `Go` is the language I love. I don't know why, but I just love it. Maybe it's because I came from a high-level programming language that lacks different aspects that can be solved with a compiled language like Go.
