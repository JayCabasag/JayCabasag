### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a Software engineer and working as a front end engineer here in the Philippines

I love programming, I know we hate it sometimes. But what I love about programming is that, it unlocks an infinite knowledge in this modern era. It's like you're exploring an endless dungeon of ideas. Competing with those world bosses in this Industry and trying to obtain achievements that legend developers ever accomplished.

So about me, I'm particularly interested at the moment on web development. I often use JavaScript/TypeScript to develop web applications and most of the time I use nodejs as my backend and when I'm developing a fullstack application. I also use other programming languages like Java and Go. I often use Java for Android Application development but I'm planning to use Java for RESTful API or Building a backend. Go is probably the language that I would love to learn under a compiled language I don't know I just love it, maybe it's because I came from a high-level programming language and seen the bad things that I've worked with it that is solved with compiled language like Go.
