### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a software engineer and front-end engineer here in the Philippines

_On top of that, I also have another GitHub account [JayCabasag99](https://github.com/JayCabasag99), which is where I frequently push my commits._

I love programming. I know we sometimes hate it, but programming unlocks infinite knowledge in this modern era.

About me, at the moment, I am particularly interested in web development. I often utilize `JavaScript/TypeScript` to develop web applications. I use `Node.js` and `React js` when I'm developing a full-stack application. I also use other programming languages like `Java` and `Go`. I use `Java` for Android application development, but I plan to build a backend or RESTful API using `Spring boot` Framework.
