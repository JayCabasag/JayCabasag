### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a software engineer specializing in frontend Development here in the Philippines

I am currently focused on web development and utilizing JavaScript/TypeScript to build robust and scalable web applications. I am proficient in both backend and frontend development, employing frameworks and libraries such as NestJS, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, React Native Expo, and Next.js. Additionally, I can develop 2D games using PIXI.js and GSAP.

My expertise extends to working with diverse databases, including MySQL, MSSQL, Firebase Firestore, and MongoDB. I can deliver end-to-end solutions for web development projects by leveraging my skills in these technologies.

Furthermore, I have basic knowledge of Rust, one of the fastest programming languages on the market. I use Rust for developing fast and secure web APIs, as well as for developing blockchains with Substrate, a framework for creating custom blockchains.
Feel free to explore my GitHub profile for examples of my work and to collaborate on exciting web development ventures.
