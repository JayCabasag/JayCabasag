### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a Software engineer and working as a front end engineer here in the Philippines

I love programming. I know we sometimes hate it, but what I love about programming is that it unlocks infinite knowledge in this modern era. It's like exploring an endless dungeon of ideas, competing with the world bosses in this industry, and trying to achieve what legendary developers have accomplished.

Regarding me, at the moment, I am particularly interested in web development. I often use `JavaScript/TypeScript` to develop web applications, and most of the time, I use `Node.js` as my backend when I'm developing a full-stack application. I also use other programming languages like `Java` and `Go`. I usually use `Java` for Android application development, but I'm planning to use it for building a backend or RESTful API. `Go` is the language that I love the most. I don't know why, but I just love it. Maybe it's because I came from a high-level programming language thats lacks in different aspects that can be solved with a compiled language like Go.
