### Hi there, my name is Jay Cabasag

#### I'm a software engineer and front-end engineer here in the Philippines

_On top of that, I also have another GitHub account [JayCabasag99](https://github.com/JayCabasag99), which is where I frequently push my commits._

About me, at the moment, I am particularly interested in web development. I often utilize `JavaScript/TypeScript` to develop web applications. I use `JavaScript/TypeScript` when I'm developing a web application starting from backend up to frontend developments. I use different frameworks for developing web applications like `NestJS`, `NodeJS`, `ExpressJS` for backend and `React JS`, `Next JS`, `Angular` for frontend. I am also knowledgeable with various databases like `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `Firebase firestore` and `MongoDB`.
